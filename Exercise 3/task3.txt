Try to delete employees Steven Thorpe and Nancy Freehafer from the database.
Does the delete operation succeed or not and why?

No, because there are foreign key constraints
and other columns depend on it.

Test
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE (first_name = 'Steven' AND last_name = 'Thorpe')
   OR (first_name = 'Nancy' AND last_name = 'Freehafer');
