Explain what is special about the database user root. Why root user should always have a strong password?
Why remote login should always be disabled for root user?
Explain how to disable remote login from root user.

Root user should have a strong password to mitigate the chance of a brute force attack,
and beacuse root has access to all of the database.

Disabling remote login for the root user reduces the risk of external attacks,
such as brute-force attempts, by limiting access to local connections only.

UPDATE mysql.user SET Host='localhost' WHERE User='root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
This restricts root access to the local machine only.
